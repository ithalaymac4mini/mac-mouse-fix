/// This emulates Swift's `defer` feature in Objective-C.
///     I don't like Swift but that's a good feature.
///
/// Usage example:
///
///     ```
///     {
///         printf("First\n");
///         MFDefer ^{ printf("Deferred 1\n"); };
///         printf("Middle\n");
///         MFDefer ^{ printf("Deferred 2\n"); };
///         printf("Last\n");
///     }
///     ```
///     Output:
///         First
///         Middle
///         Last
///         Deferred 2
///         Deferred 1
///

/// Will MFDefer still be invoked when an exception is thrown?
///     -> I haven't tested (as of Nov 2024) but I think so. The GCC docs seem to suggest that `__attribute__((cleanup(...))` will be invoked during the 'stack unwinding' that happens when an exception is thrown.
///     -> Src: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.1.0/gcc/Common-Variable-Attributes.html#index-cleanup-variable-attribute
///
/// We could have made the MFDefer macro look like really cool objc @keyword
///         like this: `@defer { ... };` instead of `MFDefer ^{ ... };`
///     -> we could've done that by using the technique that is used for the `@strongify` `@weakify` macros.
